Nancy Intro
============

This is the material I'm using for an introductory talk on Nancy at the local .NET User Group (GLUGNet). 

The slides for the presentation are stored in [\slides](https://github.com/hyrmn/NancyIntro/tree/master/slides).

The slides are built from [\slidesouce](https://github.com/hyrmn/NancyIntro/tree/master/slidesource) using [Hieroglyph](http://docs.hieroglyph.io/en/latest/)

Sample app we'll be building up:

WhatTheNancy; a single-purpose website for generating commit messages.

- Home page that shows a random commit message; should render as HTML, json, text, xml
- About page
- Secured page for adding messages

Additional information about each step is stored in the respective directory. Start with [01_routing_and_testing](https://github.com/hyrmn/NancyIntro/tree/master/01_routing_and_testing) and go on from there.
